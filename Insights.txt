Dashboard Insights – Bike Buyers Analysis

This Excel dashboard visualizes data from the Bike Buyers dataset to explore customer trends and behavior.

Key Findings

- Age-Based Trend:  
  Middle-aged customers are the top buyers of bikes. Purchases significantly drop for both adolescents and older age groups.

- Income vs Purchase:  
  Customers who did not purchase a bike had a higher average income than those who did. This may indicate a preference for other transportation options among high earners.

- Gender Comparison:  
  Both genders have comparable income levels. However, the bike purchase rate remains slightly higher in males across income brackets.

- Commute Distance Influence:  
  The majority of bike buyers commute 0–1 miles. Bike purchases steadily decline with longer commute distances.

- Segmented Insights via Slicers:  
  Users can slice data by Marital Status, Education, Region, and Gender to explore bike purchases in different customer segments.

Dashboard Built Using:

- Excel Pivot Tables
- Slicers for interactivity
