## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Age-Based Trend  
Middle-aged customers are the highest bike purchasers. Purchases dip sharply among both adolescents and older individuals.

### 2. Income vs Purchase  
Interestingly, customers who didn’t purchase a bike had a higher average income. This suggests that high earners may prefer other transport modes or value propositions.

### 3. Gender Comparison  
Although average incomes are similar, males showed a slightly higher tendency to purchase bikes.

### 4. Commute Distance Influence  
The highest rate of bike purchases occurred in customers who commute **0–1 miles**. The likelihood drops as distance increases.

### 5. Segmented Exploration  
With Excel slicers, users can segment trends by Region, Education, Marital Status, and Gender for tailored insights.
